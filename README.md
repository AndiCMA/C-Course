---------------Purpose---------------
The goal of this repo is to introduce someone new to programming or C++ to:
The structure of a C++ project
Basic to intermediate language features
How C++ handles memory, functions, classes, templates, exceptions, and more
Real-world idioms and STL usage

---------------Topics Covered---------------
Each concept is organized into its own .cpp and .h file pair for clarity:
BasicOperations – math, logic, and variable manipulation
CodeStructure – main structure of a C++ application
AdvanceDataTypes – enums, structs, and more
Functions – basic functions, overloading
PointersReferences – pointers, references, memory basics
